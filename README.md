# Flash Card Project 🎴

A simple flash-card quiz app written in Python.  

---

## 🧠 What It Does

- Loads data from a collection of flash cards  
- Shows a question / prompt (for example, a term in one language, definition in another, or similar)  
- Waits for user input or lets user think, then reveals the answer  
- Moves on to next card  
- Tracks progress (which cards have been seen / which remain)
